# LEVERAGING ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO PREDICT AND ASSESS CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN LAGOS STATE
this project was developed as part of my final year project for the completion of my degree at Lagos state University. the goal of this project was to train and deploy a model to predict weather condition and capturing the complexities of the environmental systems. 

**Problem Statement**<br>
Despite the progress made in understanding and addressing climate change, significant challenges remain in predicting its impacts and developing effective mitigation strategies. Traditional climate models often struggle to capture the complexities of environmental systems, leading to uncertainties in predictions (Ramanathan & Feng, 2019). Furthermore, in the context of environmental sustainability, there is a pressing need to develop and implement data science models that can accurately predict climate change impacts and suggest practical mitigation strategies. This project seeks to address this gap by leveraging advanced data science techniques to enhance the accuracy of climate predictions and provide actionable insights for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.

**System Architecture**<br>
The architecture of the climate prediction tool consists of two main components: the frontend and the backend, both working together to provide a seamless experience for users.
•	Frontend: The frontend interacts with the user by collecting inputs (such as year, month, and day) and displaying the prediction results. It also includes animations and design elements to improve the overall interface. The key technologies used for the frontend are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	Backend: The backend handles the requests from the frontend, processes the input data, and interacts with the machine learning models to return predictions. Flask is used as the backend framework, which communicates with the trained machine learning models (saved as .pkl files). 
•	Machine Learning Models: The climate prediction models were trained using historical climate data for Lagos State. These models are integrated into the backend and used to predict the future climate based on user input.

**Frontend Development**<br>
The frontend development of the web application includes several key components. The HTML structure serves as the foundation, featuring a welcome page, input forms, and sections to display prediction results. CSS styling enhances the user experience with a modern, semi-transparent glassmorphism effect, while also ensuring responsive design for adaptability across devices. JavaScript functionality is utilized for user input validation, sending requests to the backend, and dynamically displaying results. Additionally, special effects such as animated rain and lightning were implemented on the welcome page using CSS animations, creating an engaging, weather-themed experience for users.

**Backend Development**<br>
The backend development of the climate prediction platform was implemented using Flask, a lightweight web framework known for its simplicity and flexibility. Flask was chosen due to its minimalistic nature, which makes it easy to set up and efficient in handling HTTP requests. This framework allows for seamless integration with machine learning models, making it ideal for deploying the prediction models developed in the project. The backend is responsible for managing all interactions between the user interface and the machine learning models, ensuring smooth communication and quick responses to user input.
The Flask routes play a critical role in this communication. When users submit inputs via the frontend, these inputs are processed by Flask, which in turn sends them to the appropriate machine learning model for prediction. The framework efficiently handles these requests and returns the results in real time, making it possible for the user to view climate predictions almost instantaneously. The scalability of Flask also supports the potential future expansion of the platform, whether it's by adding new features or handling increased traffic.
For the integration of machine learning models, the trained models were saved as .pkl files after the training phase. These models include data for predicting key climate variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. Using Flask, the backend loads these pre-trained models into memory and uses them to make predictions based on user inputs. The use of Random Forest models for prediction was a deliberate choice due to the algorithm’s robustness and ability to handle a wide range of data types. 
 
**User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)**<br>
The design of the web interface was focused on providing a simple and intuitive experience. The use of responsive design ensures compatibility across various devices. Special attention was paid to the color scheme, font choices, and use of weather-related icons to enhance readability and accessibility.

**Challenges and Solutions**<br>
A significant challenge was integrating the machine learning models with the backend while ensuring real-time predictions. This was addressed by optimizing model loading times and utilizing asynchronous JavaScript for smoother performance. Another challenge was maintaining responsive design and visual appeal across different screen sizes, which was solved through CSS media queries and a flexible layout.

**Programming Language Choice**<br>
The choice of programming language is critical in system development, impacting performance, scalability, and maintainability. For the climate prediction tool, Python was selected as the primary language due to its versatility and strong ecosystem for data science and machine learning.
•	Integration: Python integrates seamlessly with machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy for building predictive models.
•	Web Development: Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, was used for the backend. Its flexibility and simplicity made it suitable for the small to medium-scale nature of this project.
•	Scalability: Python's capability to handle large datasets and its compatibility with deployment platforms like PythonAnywhere ensures scalability as the system evolves.

**System Requirements**<br>
**Hardware Requirements**<br>
The climate prediction tool has minimal hardware requirements, as it is a web-based application. It can be deployed on platforms like PythonAnywhere or Heroku, or on local servers with the following specifications:
•	Processor: 2.0 GHz dual-core processor (e.g., Intel i5 or AMD equivalent).
•	Memory: At least 4 GB of RAM.
•	Storage: Minimum 20 GB of SSD storage for models and application files.
•	Network: Reliable internet connectivity.

 **Software Requirements**<br>
•	Operating System: Linux (preferred), but compatible with Windows or macOS.
•	Python 3.x: The programming language for the backend and machine learning models.
•	Libraries: Scikit-learn, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (if needed for visual output).
•	Database: SQLite 3 for local storage of data and predictions.
•	Web Server: Gunicorn or uWSGI for running the Flask application in production.

**System Testing**<br>
Integration testing and model accuracy testing were key aspects of ensuring the platform's reliability. Integration testing verified smooth interaction between the frontend, backend, and machine learning models. The flow of data was tested from user input through the backend to model prediction and back to the frontend display. This ensured that user inputs were correctly processed, predictions were generated without errors, and results were displayed seamlessly on the interface.
For model accuracy, the Random Forest model was validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure reliable predictions based on historical climate data. This testing ensured that the predictions were reasonably accurate and robust, offering users trustworthy climate forecasts.
